## Renovator Application

## Introduction

Renovator is a Sinatra application using an MVC structure. This application uses sqlite3 to store data and ActiveRecord to create associations.

## Overview

This application enables the user to easily build home-renovation projects and include relevant details for each project, such as a title, a description, and an estimated cost. As projects are added to a user's account, the total cost of all projects logged will increase accordingly. Users can create, read, update, and delete each project.

## Running This Application

1. Fork and clone this repo.
2. In your terminal, cd into the directory.
3. Run "bundle install" to install all required gems in the gemfile.
4. Run "shotgun" to start a local server.
5. Navigate to the local host in your browswer.
6. Sign up for an account by entering a username and a password.
7. Build some home-renovation projects! :)
